                Early Childhood Education
        </h1>

              <p className="text-center pt-10 mx-4">Multiple studies show that children with engaged parents, who attend a quality preschool program and those who participate in effective school partnerships perform better in school, are less likely end up on public assistance and/or to turn to crime later in life and are ultimately happier and earn more in their lifetimes.
            </p>

              <p className="text-center pt-10 mx-4">
                The Chance Project employs a multi-pronged approach designed to maximize the power of early childhood education and family development.
            </p>

              <p className="text-center pt-10 mx-4">
                We have established partnerships with school districts, non-profits, and faith based organizations to provide the highest quality early childhood education services to the most vulnerable children and families throughout Southern California.
            </p>

              <p className="text-center pt-10 mx-4">
                We create and support partnerships with early childhood education organizations to expand universal access to all children and families who desire it. This is truly the only way to improve the American education system.
            </p>


              <p className="text-center pt-10 mx-4">
                Our K-12 Partnership provide access and support to quality K-12 experiences regardless of location or family income level..

                    The I READ (Ready, Eager, Able, Developed) Initiative focused on an important predictor of school success and high school graduationâ€”grade-level reading by the end of third grade. Research shows that children who fall behind early in their education are unlikely to ever catch up. If a child does not attain a solid educational foundation in reading by the end of 3rd Grade, he or she will likely struggle for the rest of their lives.
