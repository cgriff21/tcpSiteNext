              Early Childhood Education
            </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">Research has found that the best way to improve economic mobility is through investing in early childhood education, but the increasing costs of early education is creating a stumbling block, especially for low-income families. It's a form of structural inequality that keeps the poor from improving their lives.

              90% of a childâ€™s brain is fully developed by the age of 5 years old. For this reason, The Chance Project has adopted a Cradle to Career approach that starts immediately at the very beginning..</p>
